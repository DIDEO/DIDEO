The Potential Drug-drug Interaction and Potential Drug-drug Interaction Evidence Ontology (DIDEO)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A new foundational representation of potential drug-drug interactions
(PDDIs) that covers the material entities and processes in the domain
of discourse for PDDI evidence and knowledge claims. The
representation will enable the integration of drug interaction
mechanisms, effects, risk factors, severity, and management options
with the chemical and pharmacological properties (e.g., chemical
structure, function, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties)
of the interacting drugs.

A description of the goals of the project can be found in the
following workshop paper located in the docs/DIDEO-discussion-ICBO-Brochhausen-2014.pdf:

Ontology development guidelines: 
------------------------------------------------------------

All development is done in the development OWL file located at development/dideo.owl
There is a development purl, http://purl.obolibrary.org/dideo/dev/dideo.owl which always points to development file on the master branch.

The dideo.owl file in the base directory is the most recent release version and has the purl, [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/dideo.owl](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/dideo.owl).
